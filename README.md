# A Pytorch implementation of "Learning Latent Subspaces in Variational Autoencoders"

## Motivation
- Algebra is a beauty!
- (Partially) Explanable subspaces and neural networks!

## What this repo does
- It reproduced the experiment on the Swiss Roll toy data.

## Result
![placeholder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qq456cvb/CSVAE/master/illustration.png)

You can see that data overlaps in Z while separable in W! The reconstruction is also near-perfect!
